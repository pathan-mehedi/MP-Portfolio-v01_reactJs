# A Stunning Portfolio with React JS using Styled-Components and framer-motion.

This repository contains Final code for The Portfolio Website in ReactJS. <br />

You'll get code files which contans code for responsive portfolio website with
all the animations showed in the demo.
Also, I have used React Lazy loading to increase loading speed.

I have recently updated all the required dependencies for React Portfolio Website.
You might see some differences in implementation such as,

- In implementing react-router

- In the index.js file we are no longer using ReactDOM since we can use createRoot in React 18.
